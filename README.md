# Home_Sales

## In this activity I used my knowledge of SparkSQL to determine key metrics about home sales data. After this step, I used Spark to create temporary views, partition the data, cache and uncache a temporary table, and verify that the table has been uncached.

### I ran queries which showed the results for:
- What is the average price for a four-bedroom house sold for each year
- What is the average price of a home for each year it was built that has three bedrooms and three bathrooms
- What is the average price of a home for each year that has three bedrooms, three bathrooms, two floors, and is greater than or equal to 2,000 square feet
- What is the "view" rating for homes costing more than or equal to $350,000
- Filter out the view ratings with an average price of greater than or equal to $350,000. Determine the runtime and compare it to uncached runtime
- Filter out the view ratings with an average price of greater than or equal to $350,000
